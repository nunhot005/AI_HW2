# AI_HW2
8 puzzle game #2

## Description:

First, you need to rename your <student_id>-hw1.py to be just hw1.py. Optionally, you can wait until I upload hw1.py after HW 1 deadline passes. Put hw1.py file in the same folder as your hw2 file.

In this assignment, you will implement 5 functions and classes related to the graph search algorithm to solve 8-puzzle game. In the template file itcs451-hw2.py, you will see "# TODO: " from 1 to 5. You can read the documentation for what you need to do in detail. Here is a summary:

1. eightPuzzleH1(): the heuristic number 1 (see the slide).

2. eightPuzzleH2(): the heuristic number 2 (see the slide).

3. GreedyFrontier: a frontier for the greedy search strategy.

4. AStarFrontier: a frontier for the A* search strategy.

5. graph_search(): the graph search algorithm.
